# X-SAMPA to IPA Converter

Simple website that takes [X-SAMPA](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) text
and outputs its [IPA](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) equivalent.
Pretty much just a programming excersize to get myself more familiarized with JS, HTML, CSS, etc.

This website uses the font [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.
