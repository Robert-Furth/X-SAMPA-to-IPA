# X-SAMPA to IPA Converter

Simple website that takes [X-SAMPA](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) text
and outputs its [IPA](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) equivalent.

Pretty much just a programming excersize to get myself familiarized with JS, HTML, CSS, etc.
Do whatever you want with this. I honestly don't care.

(This website uses the font [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) by Mozilla.)
